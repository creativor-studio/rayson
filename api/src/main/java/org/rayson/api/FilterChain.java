 * A FilterChain is an object provided by the client and server to the developer

 * Filters use the FilterChain to invoke the next filter in the chain, or if the
 * calling filter is the last filter in the chain, to invoke the service at the
 * end of the chain. <br>
 * Typically, a filter chain hash a method as following:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * 	&#47;**
*	 * Causes the next filter in the chain to be invoked, or if the calling
*	 * filter is the last filter in the chain, causes the resource at the end of
*	 * the chain to be invoked.
